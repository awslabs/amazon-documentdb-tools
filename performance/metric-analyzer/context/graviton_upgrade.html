<h1>Upgrading Instances to Graviton2</h1>
<p>AWS Graviton2 processors are custom built by AWS using 64-bit Arm Neoverse cores and provide significant performance and cost benefits over previous generation instances. R6g instances offer up to 30% better price/performance compared to R5/R4 instances, with r6g instances 5% less expensive than their r5 counterparts.</p>

<h2>Considerations before upgrading to Graviton2:</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Performance benefits</strong>: Graviton2 instances provide better CPU performance and memory encryption, which can improve overall database performance.</li>
<li><strong>Application compatibility</strong>: No application changes are required when migrating from Intel to Graviton2 instances on Amazon DocumentDB.</li>
<li><strong>Instance size mapping</strong>: Ensure you select the appropriate Graviton2 instance size that matches or exceeds your current workload requirements.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Additional considerations:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Identify the appropriate Graviton2 instance type (r6g) that corresponds to your current instance</li>
<li>To minimize downtime, consider modifying your replicas first, then promoting the replicas before modifying the primary instance</li>
<li>Monitor performance after the upgrade to ensure expected improvements are realized</li>
</ol>
