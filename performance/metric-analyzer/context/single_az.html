<h1>Single Instance Deployment Considerations</h1>
<p>Running a DocumentDB cluster with only a single instance provides no high availability and no read scaling capabilities. For production workloads, it is recommended to deploy a cluster with at least one replica instance.</p>

<h2>Considerations before adding replica instances:</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>High availability needs</strong>: Single-instance clusters have no automatic <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/failover.html" target="_blank">failover</a> capability, resulting in longer downtime during instance failures.</li>
<li><strong>Read scaling requirements</strong>: Without replicas, all read operations must be processed by the primary instance.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance impact</strong>: With replicas, maintenance operations can be performed with minimal downtime.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Additional considerations:</h2>
<ol>
<li>For production workloads, deploy at least one replica instance (two total instances)</li>
<li>For critical workloads, consider deploying two replica instances (three total instances)</li>
<li>Amazon DocumentDB clusters can be <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/db-cluster-stop-start.html" target="_blank">stopped and started</a>, helping to manage costs for development and test environments</li>
<li>Configure read preference to secondaryPreferred to utilize replica instances for read operations</li>
<li>Monitor replica lag to ensure acceptable data consistency</li>
</ol>
